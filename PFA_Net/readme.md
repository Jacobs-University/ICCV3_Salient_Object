# Impelmentation of the the PFA MODEL.

First we install dependecies. The code is written python 3.7.

Following are the dependencies to train the model.
  
  1. torchvision==0.3.0
  2. torch==1.1.0
  3. opencv-python
  4. numpy
  5. tqdm

Else intsall the dependecies using https://github.com/Jacobs-University/ICCV3_Salient_Object/blob/main/PFA_Net/requirements.txt file.

## Data
Download the data from the data directory. And follow the same folder structure to train the model. Otherwise download data zip file.

## Training.

Intially, create same directory and sub directory folders as shown in the github link. Then use command python train.py in your prefer enviorment.

## Models.
In the model folder you can download the files from this link https://jacobsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/pkashid_jacobs-university_de/Ene81PkIBiJCrtkR_yEqUZUBFTU4SJBkM-UgolI7FvnBgw?e=jgWvSl and comapre a loss.

## Testing
In testing, use the command python inference.py to test your model. Make sure that you have given correct model path in the inference file.
